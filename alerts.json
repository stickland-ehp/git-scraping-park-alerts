QPWS continue to receive reports of these canisters washing up on beaches at K&rsquo;gari, Mulgumpin (Moreton Island) and Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island).</p> <p><strong>The canisters contain a rat poison known as &lsquo;aluminium phosphide&rsquo;, a white to grey solid which is hazardous to humans.</strong></p> <p>When the canister is opened, the powder reacts with moisture in the air to release phosphine gas, which is also highly toxic to humans. The gas has a strong odour that can smell like garlic, rotting fish or urine, but it can quickly dull the sense of smell.</p> <p>Exposure can cause symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, dizziness, tightness of the chest, diarrhoea, fluid in the lungs, liver/kidney damage, and in severe cases death.</p> <p>The gas is also flammable and can spontaneously ignite causing burns or small explosions.</p> <p>The canisters are silver in colour and approximately 22 centimetres tall. They have a tapered top with a screw in lid.

To address these environmental concerns, we actively engage in annual pest management programs to control their populations and minimise their impact, using a range of control techniques based on National Codes of Practice and Standard Operating Procedures.</p> <p><em>Visitor safety is our main priority, which is why during quieter periods, we implement temporary closures of campsites and other sections of Park to conduct necessary pest control activities to meet the objectives of our approved pest strategy. Park visitors play a crucial role in this effort and are kindly reminded to securely store their food and rubbish. This simple action helps prevent attracting pests and exacerbating the issue, ensuring a safer and healthier environment for all park users.</em></p> <p><em>Further information on the Department&rsquo;s Management programs for Pest plants and animals can be found at - <a href=\"https://parks.desi.qld.gov.au/management/programs/pest-plants-animals\">https://parks.desi.qld.gov.au/management/programs/pest-plants-animals</a></em></p> <p>Please observe all signage, barriers and directions from rangers and do not enter closed areas.</p> <p>For your safety please avoid interaction with the wildlife.</p>",
