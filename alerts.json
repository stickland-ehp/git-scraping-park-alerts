Over the last two months, canisters have been reported washed up on beaches at K&rsquo;gari, Mulgumpin (Moreton Island) and Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island).</p> <p>The canisters contain a rat poison known as &lsquo;aluminium phosphide&rsquo;, a white to grey solid which is hazardous to humans.</p> <p>When the canister is opened, the powder reacts with moisture in the air to release phosphine gas, which is also highly toxic to humans. The gas has a strong odour that can smell like garlic, rotting fish or urine, but it can quickly dull the sense of smell.</p> <p>Exposure can cause symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, dizziness, tightness of the chest, diarrhoea, fluid in the lungs, liver/kidney damage, and in severe cases death.</p> <p>The gas is also flammable and can spontaneously ignite causing burns or small explosions.</p> <p>The canisters are silver in colour and approximately 22 centimetres tall. They have a tapered top with a screw in lid.

Motorists and visitors to Cooloola and Inskip Peninsula Recreation Areas are asked to minimise disturbance and human impacts on this important breeding ground for marine turtles.</p> <p>Motorists should exercise caution and look out for turtles and turtle hatchlings when traversing on the beach, and plan to travel at low tide, if safe to do so. If turtles are making their way across the beach, motorists should slow down, stop and wait for the turtles to reach the ocean or the dunes, before continuing to drive.&nbsp;</p> <p>Avoid driving on the beach at night, if possible, as this is when turtles will lay their eggs, and hatchlings are most likely to be emerging.</p> <p>At night, artificial lights can affect a turtle&rsquo;s ability to see the natural horizon over the ocean. Hatchlings can easily become disoriented, veer from their natural path and head towards the artificial light. During the breeding season you can help cut the glow of lights affecting beaches by switching off unnecessary lights, shade lights to reduce the illuminated area, and only use a small torch (less than 100 lumens) on the beach.</p> <p>Remember, driving over vegetated dunes is dangerous and prohibited. It is damaging to the environment and can impact turtle nests.</p> <p>On-the-spot fines may apply to visitors disturbing turtle hatchlings or turtle nests.</p> <p>Observe all signage, barriers and directions from rangers.</p>",
