QPWS continue to receive reports of these canisters washing up on beaches at K&rsquo;gari, Mulgumpin (Moreton Island) and Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island).</p> <p><strong>The canisters contain a rat poison known as &lsquo;aluminium phosphide&rsquo;, a white to grey solid which is hazardous to humans.</strong></p> <p>When the canister is opened, the powder reacts with moisture in the air to release phosphine gas, which is also highly toxic to humans. The gas has a strong odour that can smell like garlic, rotting fish or urine, but it can quickly dull the sense of smell.</p> <p>Exposure can cause symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, dizziness, tightness of the chest, diarrhoea, fluid in the lungs, liver/kidney damage, and in severe cases death.</p> <p>The gas is also flammable and can spontaneously ignite causing burns or small explosions.</p> <p>The canisters are silver in colour and approximately 22 centimetres tall. They have a tapered top with a screw in lid.

      "details": "<p>Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service &amp; Partnerships (QPWS&amp;P) is continuing to protect critical habitat supporting threatened species on Bribie Island through its pest management program for feral animals.</p> <p>Feral animals, such as pigs, foxes and horses pose a significant threat to our natural environment by disrupting ecosystems and negatively impacting native species. To address these environmental concerns, we actively engage in annual pest management programs to control their populations and minimise their impact, using a range of control techniques based on National Codes of Practice and Standard Operating Procedures.</p> <p><em>Visitor safety is our main priority, which is why during quieter periods, we implement temporary closures of campsites and other sections of Park to conduct necessary pest control activities to meet the objectives of our approved pest strategy. Park visitors play a crucial role in this effort and are kindly reminded to securely store their food and rubbish. This simple action helps prevent attracting pests and exacerbating the issue, ensuring a safer and healthier environment for all park users.</em></p> <p><em>Further information on the Department&rsquo;s Management programs for Pest plants and animals can be found at - <a href=\"https://parks.desi.qld.gov.au/management/programs/pest-plants-animals\">https://parks.desi.qld.gov.au/management/programs/pest-plants-animals</a></em></p> <p>Please observe all signage, barriers and directions from rangers and do not enter closed areas.</p> <p>For your safety please avoid interaction with the wildlife.</p>",

Motorists and visitors to Bribie Island National Park and Recreation Area are asked to minimise disturbance and human impacts to nesting marine turtles.</p> <p>When driving on the beach:</p> <ul> <li>Plan to travel at 2 hours either side of low tide. Keep to the hard sand well below the high tide line to avoid making wheel ruts that create barriers to hatchling movement down the beach.</li> <li>Avoid driving on the beach at night. This is when turtles will lay their eggs, and hatchlings are most likely to be emerging. Exercise caution and look out for turtles and turtle hatchlings when traversing on the beach.</li> <li>If turtles are making their way across the beach - slow down, stop and wait for the turtles to reach the ocean or the dunes.&nbsp;On-the-spot fines apply to visitors disturbing turtle hatchlings or turtle nests.</li> <li>Driving over vegetated dunes is dangerous and prohibited. It is damaging to the environment and can impact turtle nests, on-the-spot fines apply.</li> </ul> <p><strong>&lsquo;Cut the glow to help turtles go&rsquo;.</strong> Artificial lights can affect a turtle&rsquo;s ability to see the natural horizon over the ocean. Hatchlings can become disoriented, veer from their natural path and head towards the artificial light. When camping during the nesting season you can help cut the glow of lights affecting beaches by switching off unnecessary lights on the beach after 7.30pm.</p> <p>Observe all signage, barriers and directions from rangers.</p> <p>To report marine animal strandings (of sick, injured or dead turtles, dolphin, dugongs or whales) call&nbsp;<strong>1300&nbsp;130&nbsp;372.</strong></p> <p>Please observe all signage, barriers and directions from rangers and do not enter closed areas.</p> <p>Please monitor <a href=\"https://parks.desi.qld.gov.au/park-alerts\">park alerts</a> on the department's website for updated information.</p>",
