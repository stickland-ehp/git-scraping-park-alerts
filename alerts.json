This will help to reduce the intensity of any subsequent wildfires and provide favourable conditions for native woodland regeneration.</p> <p>Before any planned burn is undertaken, local stakeholders and booked campers will be informed.</p> <p>Smoke may be seen coming from the island at times throughout the season. Smoke can decrease visibility on the roads and on the water, so it is important that motorists and vessel masters drive safely to the conditions.</p> <p>Please observe all signage, barriers, and directions from Rangers.</p> <p>For more information, please call the Magnetic Island office on (07) 4778 5378.</p> <p>Stay up-to-date with <a href=\"https://www.qfes.qld.gov.au/Current-Incidents\">Current bushfire warnings and incidents</a> from Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES).</p>",
